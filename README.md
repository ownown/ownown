## 👋 About

Hi, I'm Oliver (he/him)

- 👨‍💼 I work for a company in the North West of England, building IoT solutions for commercial and industrial settings.
- 💻 I primarily work in C and Python, writing firmware for Nordic nrf52-based chipsets and designing Linux-based gateways.
- 📈 I have a tangential interest in data analytics/science/engineering, and it is creeping more and more into my role
- 👨‍💻 I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool, where my honours project was a proof of concept autonomous robot built on Lego Mindstorms, Raspberry Pi, and ROS2.
- 🎵 I also have a degree in Music Composition from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. I'm slowly starting to play guitar again, and gradually thinking about writing something.
